Final Year University Project: Procedural city generation populated with intelligent agents

This repo is for the Unity project of my program Citizens, and will also include the scenarios which compromise my university final year project "Silvania City". 

Citizens itself is a framework which generates a procedural city, with simple citizens who can navigate the city. Silvania City is a scenario built into this which allows the citizens to perform more interesting tasks.

Built with Unity 2020.3.12f1
